# Personal-Fitness-Tracker
This project presents a machine learning-based approach to predicting personalized calorie burn. A random forest regressor model is trained on a dataset of exercise and calorie burn information, considering factors such as age, BMI, exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature. The trained model is then deployed in a user-friendly Streamlit application.
Users can input their individual characteristics and exercise parameters to receive a personalized prediction of calorie burn. The application also provides insights into how the user's characteristics compare to the overall dataset.
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning to provide personalized health and fitness recommendations. By considering individual variability in exercise and calorie burn, this approach can help users optimize their workout routines and achieve their fitness goals. The project highlights the importance of personalized recommendations in health and fitness, and showcases the capabilities of machine learning in this domain.
